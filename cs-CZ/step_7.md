## What next?

One last thing to try is to run your Raspberry Pi Pico webserver without using Thonny. Save your program as `main.py` and this time save it to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Now when the Raspberry Pi Pico is powered, even without a connection to a computer, the webserver should start. Remember, you can use the **bootsel** button to close the server, or the button on the served webpage, if you need to reconnect to Thonny and make alterations to your code.

If you have a look at [Introduction to Raspberry Pi Pico: LEDs, buzzers, switches, and dials](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/pico-intro), you can find plenty of ideas for how to improve on your Raspberry Pi Pico web server.

In the [LED firefly](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/led-firefly) project, you can learn how to wire up external LEDs to a Raspberry Pi Pico, then you could use a web interface to change the pattern your firefly blinks with.

In the [Party popper](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/party-popper) project, you can learn how to use a switch to control an RGB LED and a buzzer. You could use a web form with this project to control the colour of the LED and the tone that the buzzer plays.

In [Beating heart](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/beating-heart), you learn to use a potentiometer to control a pulsing LED, but you could also use your browser to control the pulse rate, and the potentiometer could be used to change the appearance of your webpage.
